# GAND
GAND project repo for reproducible analysis.

# Reproducible Workflow
## Nextflow
Building a nextflow pipeline that will handle everything from data download (when relevant or possible), to report building. 

## Data Download 
The data should be stored in the `data` directory under the appropriate category.
To reduce the memory footprint of this repository, we do not provide the data here.
We will provide a data access code and a data download workflow. In the meantime, we provide simple bash/zsh commands to download data. 

See `DataManifest.md` file in the `data` directory for more more information.

## Data upload
[Nextflow pipeline for data upload?](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals/issues/79)

## Containers
Singularity/Docker containers will be made available.
