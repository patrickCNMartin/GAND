# GAND
GAND project repo for reproducible analysis.

# Reproducible Workflow
## Nextflow
Running the analysis as a nextflow pipeline.

### Data 
The data should be stored in the `data` directory under the appropriate category.
To reduce the memory footprint of this repository, we do not provide the data here.
We will provide a data access code and a data download tool.

See `DataManifest.md` file in the `data` directory for more more information. 

## Containers
In the future, a Singularity container will be made available.

## Nix Flake
Potentially, the containers will be built from a Nix flake for full reproducibility.
